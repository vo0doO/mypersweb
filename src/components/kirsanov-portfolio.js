        creature-battling game
        <a href="https://polymon.polymer-project.org">Polymon</a>! It was a social
        game where we hid physical web beacons around the I/O grounds that each
        contained a Polymon. Once you collected several polymon, you could fight
        each other in a turn-based MTG-like / Pokemon-like battle.

        The game was a PWA, used QR codes to communicate between players, natively
