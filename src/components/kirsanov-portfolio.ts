      <p>
      This project contains tools, libraries and applications to analyze network measurements.
      Analyze DNS Queries describes how to fetch data from OONI and check for interference.
      Fetch Google or any server Traffic Data for analysis. Get information about an IP address.
      Check if an IP is valid for a domain</p>
      <h2>GSuite</h2>
      <p>
        For a long time I helped integrate <a href="https://russianit.ru/">PAU</a>
        from their legacy framework to google apps platpform and have worked extensively in

      <p>
        For <a href="https://events.google.com/io2017/">Google I/O '17</a> I
        worked with others making everyone's favorite
        <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">physical web</a>
        creature-battling game
        <a href="https://polymon.polymer-project.org">Polymon</a>! It was a social
        game where we hid physical web beacons around the I/O grounds that each
        contained a Polymon. Once you collected several polymon, you could fight
        each other in a turn-based MTG-like / Pokemon-like battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was a PWA, used QR codes to communicate between players, natively
        supported deep-linking and sharing via android-beam.
